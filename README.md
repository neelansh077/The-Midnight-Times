# The-Midnight-Times

--> Firstly changed the directory to desktop using (cd desktop).
--> Made a new directory named midnightTimes using (mkdir midnightTimes).
--> Changed the directory to midnightTimes using (cd midnightTimes).
--> Then created a django project.
--> Then started the project using ( django-admin startproject midnightTimes ).
--> Started the server using (python manage.py runserver).
--> Installed requests using (pip install requests).
--> Created an app named "base".
--> Then created views for home page and news page, and then added urls to home and news page.
--> In order to fetch the data from the API I defined and object in views and then called it in urls using a path similar to the above step.
--> Then in models I created a class named News which is the table name for the database, and the database is displayed on the inbuild admin page of django (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
--> Created 4 templates (home, news, navbar and main) home and news are included in the app folder.
--> Then added the templates to settings file 


I worked 3-4 hours a day to understand the functionalities.
Overall I did learn about django and how it works.
I did get the logic behind how the project should work, but was completely able to apply as I didnt know much about how backend works, and lacked backend experience. In frontend part, I was able to connect pages.
I also did get the logic behind how to connect the API with django, was unable to display it out.
